# Halfriends
App to calculate group expenses. Splitwise pet project

### A bit more
Frontend application (Vue & Typescript) with some mocks and minimal requests handling on backend side. Backend support might be added in the future, in case of needs and application success. I preferred to delay a decision on backend development stack, so mocks are used.
